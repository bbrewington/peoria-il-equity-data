Previously servicing groups of up to 70 guests and currently in contract for a group of 250 guests, Reservations takes pride in utilizing the freshest ingredients with some being sourced from local producers when available with artisan techniques in order to not compromise quality. 

We currently provide on and offsite catering which includes food as well as hospitality services as needed to smaller private functions and larger, public events. We have a company goal to extend the brand to a small brick and mortar location and a mobile unit that will both heavily utilize web and app technology to efficiently drive daily traffic to maintain the highest level of quality of our menu selections. Each extension of Reservations will offer brand familiar menu items while also providing different culinary experiences at various functions.  We believe that creating a strong brand will allow for cross marketing between each extension while also reducing the potential for over saturation.","Peoria - MBE certification expiring on August 10th, 2025",88506,https://www.eprismsoft.com/business/show?seq=88506,
